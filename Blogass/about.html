                <p>Hello my name is Michael Matwose.
                    I'am third year computer science and engineering student in adama science and technology universty.
                    I was born and raised in the capital of Ethiopia Addis Ababa in 1998 G.c. i started attending school at the age of 4 in 
                    meskaye hizunan medhanialem monastry school areound 6kilo and i graduated from kindergarten school by the age of 6 and joined
                     my elemantary classes in the same school. i have learend not the formal education only since it was monastry i have learend the language Gee'z 
                     and took marticulation on grade 10.Even though we thought that language was lame at that time  now its one of my biggest regrates not knowing Gee'z
                     after grade 12 national examinaton i joined adama science and technology universty in 2016/17 academic calander where the real life started and my first time away from 
            home for long time at the beginning it was realy harsh living here but i was eager to learn and achive something here so i stayed here for reason that reason was to learn programming
            and phyton was good way to start to thinking about computing then c++ was good introduction too but most of the coureses are useless and non applicable by the teachers we had ,by the countries
            economical social and poletical status .eventhough the curicculum is copy of some korean universty which is useless in Ethiopia.But I'am computer entusiast
             interested in graphics design and front end design so i start digging on my own rather waiting for education system to be changed .Now I am owner 
             and CEO of the e-commerece site www.abaycarts.com which is sonner going to be changed to some other company.
            and am personally doing 2 projects and i am frelance website developer.on my free time i like to watch and play football and playstation with friends, i love taking pictures i bleave 
            pictures tell the hidden story by them selfes you will see some of my pictures down here  </p>
